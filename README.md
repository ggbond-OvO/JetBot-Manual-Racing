# JetBot-Manual-Racing

## Project Overview
This project is based on the JetBot platform and implements **manual racing control via on-screen buttons**. Using five control buttons (forward, backward, left, right, and stop) built in a Jupyter Notebook interface, the JetBot is manually driven to complete three laps around a predefined racetrack.

## Project Implementation
- Interactive control interface built using `ipywidgets.Button`
- Each button triggers a movement command for the JetBot motors
- Motor commands are based on the official JetBot API (e.g., `robot.forward()`, `robot.left()`)

## Racing Performance

- Total time for three laps: approximately 4 minutes
- Times both wheels exited black lines: 0
- Collisions with objects: 0
- Manual interventions: 0
